Nick Lloyd\\'s **Spanish Civil War walking tour** is excellent and particularly relevant to the times. We visited **La Boqueria** market a couple of times. That might be a fun place to do a food walking tour. For me, these 3 places are a must-see in Barcelona. The Gaudi sights in Barcelona should be booked in advance.

       "  'content': \"Barcelona activities to do in 3 days: # 3-Day Itinerary // Barcelona, Spain. With so many things to do, it can be easy to spend three days enjoying Barcelona, only to get home and realize you missed some of the must-see attractions the city has to offer. I’ve combed through hundreds of sights, restaurants, and bars, and curated the best of Barcelona into this 3-day itinerary. If you know you want to do both this and the Sagrada Família, or the other Gaudí homes, you can get a bundle with this tour, or the Barcelona City Pass. #### **Day 2: Gaudí Houses and La Rambla**. #### **3-Day Barcelona Itinerary Overview**. * **Day 2**: Casa Milá, Casa Batlló, Plaça de Catalunya, La Rambla, La Boqueria, Mirador de Colom, Port Vell, Paradiso. * **Day 3**: Barceloneta, Paella, Gothic Quarter, Barcelona Cathedral, Parc de la Ciutadella, Arc de Triomf, Montjuïc Hill. #### **5-Day Barcelona Itinerary Overview**. * **Day 3:** La Boqueria, Gothic Quarter, Palau de la Musica\\\\*\\\\*, Barcelona Cathedral, Parc de la Ciutadella, Arc de Triomf, Chocolate Museum\\\\*\\\\*.\\nFor a decent introduction to Barcelona, I actually think 3 days is rather ideal, as it lets you explore the city beyond just the main sights, but doesn’t cut too much into your time in other worthy Spanish destinations (I’m assuming you’re not just coming to Barcelona), whether you’re heading onwards to Madrid, south to Andalusia, or venturing up to the little-visited northern regions. Basically, 3 days in Barcelona gives you enough time to explore various different areas and see all the city’s major attractions: the Sagrada Família, Park\\xa0Güell, the Picasso Museum, Gaudi’s Casas Batlló and Mila, and of course the Gothic Quarter and other historic areas in the center. There are lots of guided tours to Girona with pick up in Barcelona, but generally I recommend going on your own with the train and booking a walking tour directly in the city.\\n3-days Itinerary in Barcelona · Take a walk through Park Güell · Marvel at La Sagrada Família's architecture · Wander the streets of Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter).\\nFull of history and charm, the Old Town is THE place where I go every time I visit Barcelona. It’s one of the top Barcelona landmarks, and you should include it in a 3-day Barcelona itinerary. However, if it’s your first time in Barcelona, La Rambla is undoubtedly one of the places to visit. Like La Pedrera, Casa Battlò is one of the most visited monuments in Barcelona. ### **Barcelona Itinerary Day 3**. Parc de la Ciutadella is also an excellent spot if you’re visiting Barcelona with kids. You’ll visit the magnificent 11th-century Benedictine Monastery, take a funicular ride to the top of the mountain, have a short hike in Monserrat’s nature park, and enjoy one of the most exciting Barcelona day trips. ### **Best time to visit Barcelona**. With so many diversified attractions, **you can visit Barcelona at any time of the year**. **Cami Gallery Barcelona** is located in the Eixample district, close to Barcelona’s main attractions (La Rambla, Boqueria, Casa Batllò, etc.).\\nEvery trip, I make sure to revisit\\xa0**Gaudí’s masterpieces**\\xa0like\\xa0Casa Batlló, La Sagrada Família, other beautiful sights like the stunning **Barcelona Cathedral, Palau de la Música Catalana**—each one more fascinating than the last. | **Day 1** | Visit\\xa0**La Sagrada Família** | Explore\\xa0**Gothic Quarter**,\\xa0**Barcelona Cathedral**, and\\xa0**El Born** | **Tapas Tour**\\xa0in El Born and Old City |. 🎟️\\xa0**Tip:** To learn more about the history of Barcelona’s old city, I suggest taking a **walking tour of El Born and Gothic Quarter.** It is a great way to meet new people as well.
